## Overview

Churn analysis is the evaluation of a companyâ€™s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it. A high churn rate forces a business to compete with the stress of bringing new customers and even slight increases in it can be harmful.
